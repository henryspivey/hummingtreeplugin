== Frequently asked questions ==


= What are the requirements for who can display ads? =

None! There’s no minimum number of viewers and no applications to show ads.

= Why isn't the widget showing up? =

The widget hides when an ad blocker is detected. Try whitelisting your site and reloading the page.

= How many HummingTree widgets can I have active at once? =

Just one. 

= I see an error about my host ID. What's wrong? =

Make sure you've copied your full host ID from your HummingTree dashboard into the plugin settings page. If it's still not working, send us a message at hello@hummingtree.co.

= Can I create an ad? =

Of course! You can create template ads in seconds through [our app](https://hummingtree.co/app).
